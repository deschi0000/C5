CHECK ---> pooing on its own, but what about the self.stomach check???
CHECK ---> energy depletion regardless of action
CHECK ---> Hunger going down? -> should be going up
BUG ---> sick_check()not printing that t1 is sick after clean function
BUG ---> still getting sick after cleaning and playing? maybe not enough to eat??

BUG at_rest really messing everything up.
BUG -> day two menu popping up twice

Next time:

TODO:
- FEED COUNTER--> FOR SICKNESS!       if hunger is at 0, fed 3 more times.



-RANDOM SLEEPING --> REST ON ITS OWN (IF HEALTH BELOW? OR TRULY RANDOM?)

- Frames and animation
