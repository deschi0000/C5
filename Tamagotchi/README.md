# Simple Command Line Tamagotchi

This is a simple command line tamagotchi program written using python for the Centennial Codehort Coding Challenge.

It is a turn-based version of the Japanese game which allows a player to care for their virtual pet through prompts and feedback, with some fun little animations thrown in as well. 

Thanks for checking it out folks!

## FAQ

#### Is it turn-based?

Why yes it is. Each day is divided into a morning, noon and night with one day essentially being a year of a tamagotchi's life. Depending on what the limit is set to, the decisions taken will your pet may make it happily all the way to the end and die peacefully of old age, or, likewise, early from neglect and miscare. The game does try to hint so it doesn't happen, but geez, just feed the thing.


#### But it isn't anything like an actual tamagotchi...

I am aware of that- I never played with one and my research was limited to my spare time. From what I did know about the game, I worked to fulfill the coding challenge's requirements and make it somewhat playable. It will need much much much more testing for the stats to make sense, though a simple playthrough will be enjoyable, with some fun little motifs and even an easter egg or two thrown in (pun intended)
