A small repository of my submissions to the Coding Challenges at Centennial College's Coding club.

While they differ in size and scope from one another (with the Tamagatchi project and 
the html creater representing two extremes on the spectrum) each was a humble attempt to solve a specific problem.
As such, I felt that, with the exception of Tamagotchi, this readme would serve as a short, general overview for the repos. 


## Convolve
- Create a function or method called convolve() that takes a a 2d array of floating point numbers and returns a 2d array of floating point numbers. The function/method will sum every 3x3 section of the 2d array and return a new 2d array based on the summed numbers.
```bash
matrix_1 = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 0], 
            [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], 
            [0, 0, 1, 0, 1], 
            [0.5, 0, 0, 1, 0]]
            
print_output(convolve(matrix_1))

# oputput >>> [[6, 5, 4], [3.5, 3, 3]] 
```
